Determines matching Documents

Elasticsearch uses a structure called an inverted index, which is designed to allow very fast full-text searches. An inverted index consists of a list of all the unique words that appear in any document, and for each word, a list of the documents in which it appears.

Elasticsearch uses Apache Lucene to create and manage this inverted index.
