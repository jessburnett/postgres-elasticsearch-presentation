# Restore from the Log

New Machine

Known Good Backup

Replay log to get up to date

Note:
Take snapshots and then replay log entries that have occurred since then

Could hold entire log, might get too big or take too long to replay

This intermediate position allows for up to date restoration without a crazy number of backups
