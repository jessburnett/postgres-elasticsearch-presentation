Your system is a collection of

# Data and Indexes

The log is the ordered list of

# Changes

Note:
View the system as a whole via the interfaces it provides

CRUD operations operate over data

Search operates over indexes

The technique here can be applied to all interfaces - e.g. caching / analytics / backups
